Task 1:
Please create a free account and public Git repository on GitHub for this test.
The solution for each question should be committed to different branches.
You are encouraged to make incremental commits, rather than commit everything once the solutions are finished.
You should also write down your assumptions.
Bonus: create unit tests to verify your solutions.

1. Write a script that accepts a positive integer range and, for each increment in the range, prints:
   - "Fizz" if a multiple of 3
   - "Buzz" if a multiple of 5
   - The integer itself otherwise.
   
   E.g. for f[12..16], the output is "Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16".

2. Do the same as question 1, except in addition to the previous rules, now it prints "Bazz" instead of an integer after consecutive Fizzes/Buzzes.

  E.g. for f[4..11], the output is “4 Buzz Fizz Bazz 8 Fizz Buzz Bazz”.
									

Task 2:

Assumptions:
1. The webserver has been configured correctly to direct the URL specify below to getinfo.php.
2. The Mysql Server has been configured and running.

Please raise at least 10 suggestions/corrections about these codes.


data.sql
- 	Can't create table 'HDB' 
	Reason: InnoDB engine generates an error, it should MyISAM
- 	Can't create table 'Condo' 
	Reason: -	InnoDB engine generates an error, it should MyISAM
			-	Incorrect table definition, there can be only one auto column and it must be defined as a key

getinfo.php
-	unexpected ')' in getinfo.php on line 4
-	Can't use function return value in write context in getinfo.php on line 8
	if (is_object($data) == true) $status = '200 OK';		
-	Class 'dataObj' not found in getinfo.php on line 6
-	Can't use $ArrayURL[1] as parameter because $ArrayURL[1] = domain. Replace $ArrayURL[1] with $_GET["param"]

data.php
-	Call to a member function fetch_assoc() on a non-object in data.php on line 23
-	private $table = null; must be defined
-	SELECT * FROM $table WHERE ID = $id (replace $table with $this->table)
